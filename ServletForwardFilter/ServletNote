Filter Mapping and chain
wild cad (/*) uri-pattern is resolved first
and then filter with servlet name mapping

Annotation filter order of execution is based on class name in alphabetically.
The other can not be defined using annotation
However we can switch the other in the xml how?
it is the first, first to be executed
use annotation: @WebFilter(name="fiterName") at the filter class level
in xml:

 <filter-mapping>
<filter-name>filterName</filter-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
